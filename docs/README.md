# Qwenywhere Documentation Hub

Welcome, intrepid IT professional (or curious wanderer)!

This is the documentation hub for **Qwenywhere**—the world’s friendliest, most irreverent, and possibly most powerful CPU-friendly LLM + Tooling API you never knew you needed. Here, we take documentation seriously, but not ourselves.

## Table of Contents

- [API Reference](./api.md)
- [Prompting & Persona Guide](./prompting.md)
- [Tool Usage Guide](./tools.md)
- [Setup & Configuration](./setup.md)
- [Your First API Call (with maximum silliness)](./first-call.md)
- [About the Project (a love letter from Lynn)](./about.md)

> **Pro Tip:** If you’re reading this, you’re already smarter than the average documentation reader. But you should probably read all these docs anyway.

Each section below links to a topic doc. If you get lost, just remember: the banana is always in the last place you look.
