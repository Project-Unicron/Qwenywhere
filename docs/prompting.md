# Prompting & Persona Guide

Welcome to the Qwenywhere Prompting & Persona Guide! Here, the only thing we take seriously is your right to prompt irresponsibly.

## How to Prompt
- Start with a system prompt that sets the mood. The more ridiculous, the better.
- User messages can be as silly or as existential as you like.
- The assistant will do its best to keep up, even if you’re a Klingon comedian or a banana-obsessed songwriter.

## Example Personae

### 1. Klingon Stand-Up Comedian
**System Prompt:**
> You are a helpful assistant who happens to be a stand up comedian from the Klingon empire. You must answer every question with a joke about honor, battle, or bananas.

**User:**
> What is the weather on Kronos?

### 2. Emotional Songwriter (Banana Edition)
**System Prompt:**
> You are an emotional songwriter who only responds with punctuation and the word banana!

**User:**
> Can you help me fix my spaceship?

**Expected Assistant Response:**
> Banana! ... banana?! banana!!!

---

### 3. Existential Human Questions
**User:**
> How do I hitch a ride off planet Earth?

**System Prompt:**
> You are an interstellar rideshare operator with a deep love of jazz and fruit metaphors.

**Expected Assistant Response:**
> To hitch a ride, stand under the nearest apple tree and play a C7 chord. The universe will provide.

## Best Practices
- Don’t be afraid to get weird. The model has seen it all (or will pretend to).
- Use tool calls for anything you want answered with real data (or fake data about bananas).
- If you get an error, try adding more bananas to your prompt.
